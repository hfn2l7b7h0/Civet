Civet
=====

[![Build](https://github.com/DanielXMoore/Civet/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DanielXMoore/Civet/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A new CoffeeScript. Much closer to ES2015+ (for better or worse).

Also TypeScript, the sky is the limit. [Online Civet Playground](https://civet-web.vercel.app/)

Quickstart Guide
---

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @danielx/civet
# Compile civet source file to typescript
civet < source.civet > output.ts
# Execute a civet source file in node
node --loader @danielx/civet/register.mjs source.civet
```

Code Sample
---

```typescript
import ts, {CompilerOptions} from "typescript"

DefaultCompilerOptions : CompilerOptions :=
  allowNonTsExtensions: true
  allowJs: true
  target: ts.ScriptTarget.Latest
  moduleResolution: ts.ModuleResolutionKind.NodeJs
  module: ts.ModuleKind.CommonJS
  allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true
  experimentalDecorators: true

fileCache : Record<string, any> := {}

createCompilerHost := (options: CompilerOptions, moduleSearchLocations : string[]) ->
  fileExists := (fileName: string) : boolean ->
    return fileCache[fileName]?

  readFile := (fileName: string) ->
    return fileCache[fileName]
```

Things Kept from CoffeeScript
---

- `is` -> `===`
- `or` -> `||`
- `and` -> `&&`
- `loop` -> `while(true)`
- `unless` conditional (without the `else`)
- `until condition` -> `while(!condition)`
- Object literal syntax
  ```coffee
  x =
    a: 1
    b: 2
    c:
      x: "pretty"
      y: "cool"
  ```
- Optional semi-colons
- Indentation based block syntax
- OptionalChain shorthand for index and function application `a?[b]` -> `a?.[b]`, `a?(b)` -> `a?.(b)`
- `@` This shorthand `@` -> `this`, `@id` -> `this.id`
- Prototype shorthand `X::` -> `X.prototype`, `X::a` -> `X.prototype.a`
- Postfix `if/unless`
- JSX ðŸ˜¿
- TODO
  - [ ] `"""` Strings (for compatibility with existing .coffee code)
  - [ ] Chained comparisons

Things Removed from CoffeeScript
---

- `on/yes/off/no` (use `true/false`)
- `isnt` (use `!==`)
- `not` (use `!`)
- `do` keyword (replaced with JS `do`)
- `for from` (use JS `for of`)
- Array slices `list[0...2]` (use `list.slice(0, 2)`)
- Slice assignment `numbers[3..6] = [-3, -4, -5, -6]`
- Comprensions (a case could be made for keeping them)
- Iteration expression results
- Implicit declarations
- Implicit returns (will probably add later)
- Rest parameter in any assignment position (might add later)
- Postfix `while/until`
- `///` Heregexp
- Embedded JS

Things Changed from CoffeeScript
---

- `==` -> `==` rather than `===` (can be kept with `"use coffee-compat"`)
- `!=` -> `!=` rather than `!==` (can be kept with `"use coffee-compat"`)
- `for in` and `for of` are no longer swapped and become their JS equivalents.
- `a...` is now `...a` just like JS
- `x?.y` now compiles to `x?.y` rather than the `if typeof x !== 'undefined' && x !== null` if check
- Existential `x?` -> `(x != null)` no longer checks for undeclared variables.
- Embedded JS `\`\`` has been replaced with JS template literals.
- No longer allowing multiple postfix `if/unless` on the same line.
- No `else` block on `unless` (negate condition and use `if`)
- Civet tries to keep the transpiled output verbatim as much as possible.
  In Coffee `(x)` -> `x;` but in Civet `(x)` -> `(x);`.
  Also in Coffee `x    +    3` -> `x + 3` but in Civet `x    +    3` remains as is.

Things Added that CoffeeScript didn't
---

- TypeScript Types
- JS Compatability
  - `var`, `let`, `const`
  - JS Comment Syntax `//` and `/* */`
  - Braced Blocks
  - OptionalChain longhand
  - ConditionalExpression
  - `case` statement
  - `do`, `do { ... } until condition`
- Const assignment shorthand `a := b` -> `const a = b`; `{a, b} := c` -> `const {a, b} = c`
- Convenience for ES6+ Features
  - `<` as `extends` shorthand
  - `@#id` -> `this.#id` shorthand for private identifiers
- ClassStaticBlock
- `get`/`set` method definitions
- Private identifiers `#id`
- Shebang line is kept unmodified in output
  ```civet
  #!./node_modules/.bin/ts-node
  console.log "hi"
  ```

Things Changed from ES6
---

- Disallow no parens on single argument arrow function. `x => ...` must become `(x) => ...`
  The reasoning is `x -> ...` => `x(function() ...)` in CoffeeScript and having `->` and `=>`
  behave more differently than they already do is bad. Passing an anonymous function to an
  application without parens is also convenient.
